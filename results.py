----------------(a)-------------------
Give the sid (a number):5
Enter your name:aryan
give a letter y or n:n
The required dictionary-- {5: 'aryan'}
The list will be used in further parts--
The required list-- [(5, 'aryan')]
Done!
----------------(b)------------------------
The dictionary we had-
{5: 'aryan'}
now we have exchanged the key value pair but its not sorted-
{'aryan': 5}
The unsorted list--
[('aryan', 5)]
The sorted list--
[('aryan', 5)]
The sorted dictionary-
{'aryan': 5}
This is the dictionary sorted on the basis of name-
{5: 'aryan'}
Done!
-----------------(c)-----------------
The list we made before will be used now-
[(5, 'aryan')]
now the list is sorted-
[(5, 'aryan')]
sorted dictionary based on sid- {5: 'aryan'}
Done!

Give a number-1
Give a number-2
[1, 2, 3]
Give y to contnue and n to stop going further-y

[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]
Give y to contnue and n to stop going further-n
Now we got a list having a fibonacci series-
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]
Average of the sequence-
34.09090909090909
